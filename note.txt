React Form Validation Hook with Schema Support
# Problem
Forms are a core part of web applications, but managing form state, validation, and error handling in React can be complex. 
Libraries like Formik and React Hook Form are popular, but they often require significant boilerplate for advanced use cases like schema-based validation, dynamic forms, or async validation. 
Developers frequently need to integrate external schema validators (e.g., Zod, Yup) manually, leading to inconsistent APIs and error-prone setups. 
Additionally, many solutions lack built-in support for accessibility (e.g., ARIA attributes for form errors) or TypeScript-first design, which are critical for modern React apps.

# Expanded Idea
Create a lightweight, hook-based form validation library for React that prioritizes simplicity, TypeScript support, and seamless integration with schema validators like Zod or Yup. The library, tentatively called useFormSchema, would provide a single, powerful hook for managing form state, validation, and submission, with the following key features:
* Schema-First Validation: Native integration with Zod, Yup, or Joi for type-safe validation schemas, allowing developers to define form structure and validation rules declaratively.
* Dynamic Form Support: Support for dynamic fields (e.g., adding/removing fields at runtime) with automatic validation updates.
* Async Validation: Built-in support for asynchronous validation (e.g., checking email availability via API) with debouncing to prevent excessive requests.
* Accessibility Focus: Automatic generation of ARIA attributes for form errors and field states, ensuring WCAG compliance.
* TypeScript-First: Strong typing for form values, errors, and validation schemas, leveraging TypeScript’s inference for minimal configuration.
* Minimal API Surface: A single useFormSchema hook that handles form state, validation, and submission, with optional utilities for common patterns (e.g., multi-step forms).
* Extensibility: Plugins for integrating with UI libraries (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design) or data-fetching tools like React Query.
* Form Analytics: Optional telemetry to track form abandonment or error rates, useful for enterprise apps.
Implementation Approach
* Core Hook: Build useFormSchema using React’s useReducer and useEffect to manage form state and validation. Example API:

// example code tsx
import { useFormSchema } from 'use-form-schema'; import { z } from 'zod';
const schema = z.object({ email: z.string().email(), password: z.string().min(8), });
const MyForm = () => { const { values, errors, handleChange, handleSubmit, isSubmitting } = useFormSchema({ schema, initialValues: { email: '', password: '' }, onSubmit: async (values) => { // Handle form submission }, });
return (
 {errors.email && {errors.email}} Submit
 ); };


 * Schema Integration: Use Zod’s parse or Yup’s validate methods to validate form data, with custom error mapping for user-friendly messages.
* Dynamic Fields: Implement a useFieldArray utility for adding/removing fields, inspired by React Hook Form’s approach but with simpler syntax.
* Async Validation: Use a debounced useEffect to handle async validation, with a configuration option for debounce timing.
* Accessibility: Automatically add ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-describedby for errors) and provide a utility to generate accessible error summaries.
* Documentation: Use Storybook for interactive examples and VitePress for a dedicated docs site with TypeScript snippets
